In this project, I built a real-time, responsive Chat Web Application similar to WhatsApp. It includes
secure user authentication, the ability to send and receive text and image messages in real time, and
lets users set their profile pictures using Cloudinary. The frontend is made with React and Tailwind
CSS for a clean and responsive design. The backend uses Node.js and Express for APIs, Socket.io for
real-time communication, and MongoDB to store the data.
